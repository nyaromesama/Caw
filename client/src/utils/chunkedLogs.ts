// Chunked eth_getLogs walker.
//
// RPCs cap the block range of a single eth_getLogs call, and the caps vary
// widely: paid tiers are around 10K-100K, while sepolia.base.org rejects
// anything wider than 500 (HTTP 413, measured 2026-10-07; it was 2,000,
// then 1,000 in 2026-09). We chunk, and
// shrink the chunk when a call fails, so the same code path works against
// any backend without operator-tuned block ranges.
//
// Two modes:
//
//   scanLogsForward  — ingest every event from `fromBlock` to `toBlock`.
//                       Used by the indexer's historical sync. Misses
//                       nothing; if a window fails, we halve it and retry
//                       from the same block (up to MAX_FORWARD_SHRINKS
//                       times), and throw if it still fails (operator
//                       gets a clear error rather than a silent hole).
//
//   scanLogsBackward — find the most recent N events fast, bail as soon
//                       as we walk into an empty window after seeing
//                       events. Used by registry-style lookups where the
//                       answer is concentrated around recent activity.
//
// Both honor a chunk-size config and a max-windows safety net. Callers
// pass `address` + `topics` directly (matches eth_getLogs RPC shape).
